class 

Nameed group of properties and functions

example:
class Human():
  contains age, name and income

*** Abstractions, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritence

Abstraction:
it is done at designing level 
- with functions
abstraction refers to the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of 
an object or a function to the outside world. 

Hide Complexity: 
Abstraction hides the complex inner workings of a class or function from the user, providing a simplified interface.

Focus on Essentials: 
It focuses on essential features and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details that are not relevant to the user.

Level of Abstraction:

Class Level:
Classes can abstract complex behaviors and properties of objects into simple methods and attributes.

Function Level:
Functions can abstract a sequence of operations into a single callable entity.

Example:
Consider a class Car that represents a car with properties like brand, model, and methods like start_engine() and drive():
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
    
    def start_engine(self):
        # Complex logic to start the engine
        print(f"{self.brand} {self.model} engine started.")
    
    def drive(self):
        # Complex logic to drive the car
        print(f"{self.brand} {self.model} is now driving.")

Abstraction Example: 
The user of the Car class doesn't need to know the intricate details of how start_engine() or drive() methods work 
internally. They only need to know how to use these methods.

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
my_car.start_engine()  # Output: Toyota Corolla engine started.
my_car.drive()         # Output: Toyota Corolla is now driving.

#encapsulation:
- with classes
It is done in implementation level.
bunduling of data into single object or entity.

#polymorphism:

poly- many
morphism - ways
act of representing single thing into multiple ways
Overriding and overloading( but not in python)

#inheritence:

example:

kids inherit properties of their parents
