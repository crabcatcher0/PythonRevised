#For loop

for item in iterable:
    # Body of the loop
    # Indented block of code to be executed for each iteration

example:
insects = ["mosquito", "housefly", "bee"]
for insect in insects:
   print(insect)

#output:
mosquito
housefly
bee

#enumerate 
iterating with index

for index, item in enumerate(iterable):
   print(index, item)

example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")
    
output:
Index 0: apple
Index 1: banana
Index 2: cherry

#While loops

while condition:
    # Code to execute while the condition is true
example:
count = 0  # Initialization

while count < 5:  # Condition
    print("The count is:", count)  # Loop body
    count += 1  # Update
